# chatbot

Few weeks ago, ChatGPT became a sensation all over social media. You might have seen so many beautiful things it can do and might have made you think: is it powerful enough to replace developers? Well, the developers are the ones that built it.

I built my first JavaScript AI that i named "teejaywurld", A ChatGPT AI 
Application using OpenAI's newest Machine Learning model with an elegant
User Interface that resembles the ChatGPT App, Communication with advanced 
GPT 3 model API and most importantly, the ability to ask the AI for help 
with whatever questions you have in mind as well as with programming languages 
such as JavaScript, Java, Python, ReactJS, Go and other programming 
languages, Giving it code and translating it to another programming language and much more.

Building this application gave me the knowledge on how to better understand 
and use the OpenAI API. I learnt how to setup a vanilla JavaScript project
using Vite, NodeJS for the server side, Creating responsive layouts with pure
CSS, Handle events with JavaScript, Render markdown from string, Using Prism 
for code highlighting, Make API requests, Catch errors, Write clean code and
then deployed it online at "https://chatbot-ten-zeta.vercel.app/".
